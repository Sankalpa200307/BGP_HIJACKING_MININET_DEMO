<h1>BGP_HIJACKING_Demo_Using_Mininet</h1>

<h2>What is BGP(Border Gateway Protocol) Hijacking?</h2>


BGP hijacking is a malicious attack on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the system responsible for routing internet traffic between autonomous systems (ASes). In this attack, a malicious actor falsely advertises ownership of IP address ranges that do not belong to them, causing data intended for the legitimate IP owner to be rerouted through the attackerâ€™s network. This can lead to various harmful outcomes, including traffic interception, data theft, or denial of service. BGP hijacking exploits the trust-based nature of BGP, which assumes that all routing announcements are accurate, making it a significant security threat to the internet infrastructure.

<h2>Instructions to run code</h2>
<h3>1.Install <a href="https://github.com/mininet/mininet/releases/download/2.3.0/mininet-2.3.0-210211-ubuntu-20.04.1-legacy-server-amd64-ovf.zip">Mininet</a></h3>
<h3>2.Install  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jj6X3OkujQ">GUI</a></h3>
<h3>3.Clone the Repository</h3>
<h3>4.Run the following commands</h3>
 &nbsp  mininet@mininet-vm:$ cd BGP_Path_Hijack/<br>
 &nbsp # replace paths in 'bgp.py' in the lines 147 and 149 ,also in `start_rogue.sh` and 'stop_rogue.sh'<br>
 &nbsp mininet@mininet-vm:$ sudo python3 bgp.py<br>
 &nbsp # new termial window, connect to S1 router, passwd is "en", type twice with [enter]<br>
 &nbsp mininet@mininet-vm:$ ./connect.sh<br>
 &nbsp # bgpd-S1# show ip bgp<br>
 &nbsp # new another window, test web service<br>
 &nbsp mininet@mininet-vm:$ ./website.sh<br>
 &nbsp # new another window, start roguing AS<br>
 &nbsp mininet@mininet-vm:$ ./start_rogue.sh<br>
 &nbsp # bgpd-S1# show ip bgp<br>
 &nbsp # check the output in `website.sh` window<br>
 &nbsp mininet@mininet-vm:$ ./stop_rogue.sh<br>
<br>
 <b>Note:</b>Make sure that you have installed FRR (free range routing) by running <b>sudo apt-get install frr</b> ,also enable and start frr by running <b>systemctl enable frr</b> and <b>systemctl start frr.</b>
