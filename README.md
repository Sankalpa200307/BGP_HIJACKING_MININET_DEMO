<h2>What is BGP(Border Gateway Protocol) Hijacking</h2>


<h6>BGP hijacking is a malicious attack on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the system responsible for routing internet traffic between autonomous systems (ASes). In this attack, a malicious actor falsely advertises ownership of IP address ranges that do not belong to them, causing data intended for the legitimate IP owner to be rerouted through the attackerâ€™s network. This can lead to various harmful outcomes, including traffic interception, data theft, or denial of service. BGP hijacking exploits the trust-based nature of BGP, which assumes that all routing announcements are accurate, making it a significant security threat to the internet infrastructure.</h6>
